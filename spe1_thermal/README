This directory contains the input data file for a version of the SPE-1
[1] problem which has been modified to include thermal effects. The
intention of it is to test the "pseudo-thermal" features of the OPM
simulators. For this reason, the dataset will probably produce errors
or incorrect results if using an ECLiPSE simulator.

The ownership of the copyright of this dataset is unclear: Some parts
seem to be written by Schlumberger [2], which in turn seem to be
modified by Jon Kleppe of NTNU [3] and some (mainly saturation
function related) data seems to be calculated by SINTEF using MRST.
Finally some modifications where done by Ove Savareid and Andreas
Lauser in the context of the OPM project.
