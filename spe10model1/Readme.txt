The model 1 of SPE10 is properly running on Eclispe,
but on Flow it gives the following error message:
"deck_filename found at /, value is SPE_MODEL1.DATA       
output not found. Using default value 'true'.            
output_dir not found. Using default value 'output'.      
Failed to create valid ECLIPSESTATE object. See logfile: output/LOGFILE.txt
Exception caught: Tried to access cell information in a grid with only dimensions"

the LOGFILE.txt see√∏s empty, apparently, Flow doesn't manage the grid.
