opm-data
========

This is the OPM repository which is supposed to contain all relevant
datasets and simulation results which are required to test the OPM
simulators thoroughly.

Decks are now provided under the open database license, and new decks
should also be provided under the same or a compatible license.

Note that the git history contains proprietary decks (now removed) where
usage restrictions may apply.
