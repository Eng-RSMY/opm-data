E_CPG_SPE9.DATA: is the Eclipse data file for SPE9 with a Corner Point Grid 
F_CPG_SPE9.DATA: is the Flow data file for SPE9 with a Corner Point Grid

Changes implemeted from last spe9_new files:
- In keyword COMPDAT item 8 (transmissibility factors) must be entered to get a match between Eclipse and Flow runs.
No match if this item is defaulted

- Last line of PVTO is calculated @ 4600 psi, not 5000psi, because the SPE paper specify a way to calculate Bo 1000psi over Psta which is 3600psi (during simulation, P does not exceed 3600 psi).

- The grid has been made on Excel. The Excel file is available to check to calculus.
