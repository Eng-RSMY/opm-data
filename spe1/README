This directory contains the input data file and results produced by
several simulation software packages of the first comparison project
of the society of petroleum engineers [1]. The dataset consists of a
single file called 'spe1deck.data' and uses the ECL format which is
used by many standard commercial simulators for oil reservoirs.

The ownership of the copyright of this dataset is unclear: Some parts
seem to be written by Schlumberger [2], which in turn seem to be
modified by Jon Kleppe of NTNU [3] and some (mainly saturation
function related) data seems to be calculated by SINTEF using MRST.
Finally some modifications where done by Ove Savareid and Andreas
Lauser in the context of the OPM project.
