This directory contains an simple input data file which is based on
the first comparison project of the society of petroleum engineers
[1]. The dataset consists of a single file called 'SIMPLESPE1.DATA'
and uses the ECL format which is used by many standard commercial
simulators for oil reservoirs.

The simplifications are that the grid consists only of a single layer
of cells, and that there is no injector well specified. (i.e., only a
producer is present.)

Just like for the SPE1 dataset, the ownership of the copyright of this
file is unclear: Some parts seem to be written by Schlumberger [2],
which in turn seem to be modified by Jon Kleppe of NTNU [3] and some
(mainly saturation function related) data seems to be calculated by
SINTEF using MRST.  Finally some modifications where done by Ove
Savareid and Andreas Lauser in the context of the OPM project.
