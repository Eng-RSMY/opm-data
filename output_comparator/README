Small python script to compare two sets of Eclipse output.

You need python installed, and ERT (github.com/Ensembles/ert.git), built with the cmake python option turned on.

To get it running, you need to set the PYTONPATH variable to the location of your ert python folder. Depending on if you have run make install or not, the location will vary, but you need to point the PYTHONPATH to the folder where the ert and ert_gui folders are located (which contains the python goodness).

The ERT python code wraps some C libraries, this may complicate things a bit for you, as this wrapping sometimes gets a bit confused. LD_LIBRARY_PATH, pointing to your libert*.so libs is a good start. Ask an ERT developer for help if in trouble. 

Usage: python compare_eclipse.py arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4, where
arg1 = <path to folder for ECLIPSE output 1>
arg2 = <path to folder for ECLIPSE output 2>
arg3 = <base input (deck) name, without .DATA>
arg4 = <relative tolerance, between 0 and 1, used for PRESSURE>
arg5 = <absolute tolerance, used for SGAS and SWAT>
